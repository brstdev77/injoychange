                <strong>Why is this core value &ndash; accountability and integrity in our operation &ndash; important to you?</strong></p>

<p>"Accountability to me is having documented evidence of what you have done, or are doing. I learned long, long ago that documentation is important. Over the years, 
    though, while working in quality assurance, that way of thinking has been reinforced over and over. &nbsp;Documentation is critical. We document protocols, policies, procedures, 
    activities and the data that is driving all of that. Without documentation you can't be held accountable. &nbsp;We're saying that we're doing all of these great things and when you have the documentation,
    it backs up that message. It's the proof. Integrity is behaving the same way without having to be accountable. It's an honorable, trusted trait. &nbsp;</p>
